# Based on Material-UI Create React App example with TypeScript

## How to use

Clone or fork the repository.
To install the app and run it use the following commands

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

To run the tests use:
```sh
npm run test
```

For the styling I used a pre-built example from Material-UI docs.
Some steps I would have taken if this was a working story would be to make a more extensive use of typescript. I would have added also react-hook-form since it has a good integration with typescript and for styling I would have used Emotion.

On the UX side if I had more time I would use something like Bootstrap tour for a quick introduction: https://bootstraptour.com/
With a feature like this we can give a better and more graphical introduction to the users to the different parts of the page/topics.
